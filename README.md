# GameGlance

The frontend implementation for a quarter-long CS130 Winter 2024 project.

## Description

GameGlance is a web application designed to simplify the process of consuming video game reviews. It addresses the problem many gamers and developers face when attempting to read and digest the often lengthy and dense reviews found online. For game lovers, this tool saves time by aggregating multiple reviews into concise summaries via Gemini API, providing a more comprehensive understanding without the need to sift through each review individually.
